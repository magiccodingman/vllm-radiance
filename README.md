# vllm-radiance

A vLLM inference server image for the **AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700 (gfx1201 / RDNA4)**. It bundles a working
ROCm + PyTorch + Triton + AITER + vLLM stack with the RDNA4 patches and custom kernels needed to run vLLM on
this card, plus RDNA4-tuned GEMM / attention / all-reduce paths and a dynamic MTP draft controller, so you
don't have to build the stack yourself.

> **Status: super early dev (v0.5.8). Experimental.** Everything here was built and measured on three exact
> setups: **Qwen3.6-27B-FP8**, **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-FP8** (fine-grained MoE, 256 experts / top-8), and
> **Gemma-4-31B-it-FP8** (block-fp8, sliding + global attention, vision), all with fp8 (or bf16/`auto`) KV
> cache on two R9700 GPUs (tensor parallel). Other models, non-FP8 weights, single or
> 3+ GPUs, and non-R9700 hardware are untested. Expect rough edges and breaking changes. Not production
> hardened. Use at your own risk.

This repository is the **source** for the image published as `stilldeadcode/vllm-radiance` on Docker Hub.
See **[DOCKERHUB.md](DOCKERHUB.md)** for the full description, the complete environment-variable / knob
reference, tested configuration, and stack versions.

## Build

Everything the build needs is in this directory (a flat Docker build context). The version string lives in
one place, the `VERSION` file, which the tag and the build-arg both read:

```bash
docker build -t vllm-radiance:$(cat VERSION) --build-arg RADIANCE_VERSION=$(cat VERSION) .
```

That single command builds everything from source, in four stages. **builder** compiles PyTorch, Triton,
torchvision, AITER, and vLLM for `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx1201` against the official `rocm/dev-ubuntu-24.04`
base (digest-pinned) and leaves the wheels in `/wheels` (it also builds `rocm-bandwidth-test` for the startup
sweep). **rocmprune** (`prune_rocm.sh`) cuts the 19 GB ROCm tree down to this one GPU architecture.
**assemble** installs the wheels, applies the RDNA4 correctness patches, and compiles the
custom HIP kernels (`router_gemm.hip`, `radiance_ar_ext.hip`, `radiance_ar_quant_ext.hip`) with the image's own
`hipcc`. **final** is the release image: a clean `ubuntu:24.04` that receives only the pruned ROCm tree, the
venv, and the entrypoint, so neither the build toolchain nor the wheels ever reach the published image. No
prebuilt component wheels, no rotating wheel indexes, and no checked-in binaries go into the image. It is a
long build (a full PyTorch compile); expect it to run for hours on a many-core box.

That structure is what keeps the download reasonable: the stock ROCm base is 7.4 GiB compressed on its own,
most of it device code for GPUs this image cannot run on. Pruning it to gfx1201 and shipping an allowlist
takes the image from 9.35 GiB compressed to **3.66 GiB**. Note the prune must happen in a stage the release
stage copies *from* -- deleting files in a layer stacked on the base reclaims nothing.

The release stage still ships a working **compiler** (hipcc, g++, and the C++/Python headers). That is
not slack to trim: AITER JIT-compiles its kernels on first use, inside the running container, so an
image without those headers boots and then dies on the first AITER module build. The build asserts it
by compiling and importing a pybind11 HIP module.

The component pins are the `ARG`s at the top of the `Dockerfile` (`TORCH_VERSION`, `TRITON_VERSION`,
`TORCHVISION_VERSION`, `AITER_VERSION`, `VLLM_VERSION`). Each one is both the git tag that gets compiled and
the version the resulting wheel reports, and the build asserts the two agree, so `pip show` and the startup
banner can be trusted. If you just want a known-good image without building, pull the published one:
`docker pull stilldeadcode/vllm-radiance`.

**Do not bump torch / triton / torchvision on their own.** They are not independent choices: vLLM pins the
torch version it is tested against, torch pins its triton, and torchvision ships a matching release. The
build runs vLLM's own `use_existing_torch.py`, which *strips* those pins — but that exists so pip does not
re-download torch, not as licence to install a newer one. Builds 0.5.0 through 0.5.4 compiled against a
newer trio and hung a GPU under sustained tensor-parallel load; restoring the pinned versions fixed it with
no code change. If you override these with `--build-arg`, move them together and soak-test under real load.

## Run

`docker-compose.yml` is the canonical way to serve. Point it at your model directory and your GPU group GIDs,
then:

```bash
# put your model at ./models/Qwen/Qwen3.6-27B-FP8  (or set MODELS=/your/model/dir)
docker compose up -d          # start; follow with: docker compose logs -f
docker compose down           # stop
```

The compose defaults target Qwen3.6-27B-FP8. To serve the fine-grained-MoE **Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-FP8**, point it
at that model and raise the batch-token budget: `--max-num-batched-tokens` must be **≥ 2240** (align mode
reconciles the GDN state to attention block size 2240; the 27B default of 2048 asserts otherwise). Its tuned
MoE config and the `RADIANCE_MOE_ROUTER` gate GEMM are baked in and turn on automatically.

To serve **Gemma-4-31B-it-FP8** (block-fp8, e.g. `RedHatAI/gemma-4-31B-it-FP8-block`), just point the compose
at it: the quantization is auto-detected from `config.json` (compressed-tensors, 128x128 blocks), the tuned
GEMM configs load by shape, and the long-context prefill attention path is tuned for its head-512 global
layers. Drop the Qwen-specific `--mamba-cache-mode` and chat template / tool-reasoning parsers (it is not a
GDN hybrid and uses its own template). Its vision tower works as-is. Note it is a *big-KV* model (60 layers,
50 sliding + 10 global), so give it a smaller `--max-model-len` than the Qwen models at the same
`--gpu-memory-utilization`.

Gemma-4-31B also supports **MTP speculative decoding** for a large decode speedup, using Google's official
drafter `google/gemma-4-31B-it-assistant` (vLLM loads it as an MTP model). It is lossless (the target
verifies every drafted token) and the dynamic draft controller applies to it. Its one requirement on this
card: the drafter has a head-512 layer, so pass `"attention_backend":"ROCM_AITER_UNIFIED_ATTN"` in the
speculative config (the usual `flash_attn` caps at head 256). For example:
`--speculative-config '{"method":"mtp","model":"/models/google/gemma-4-31B-it-assistant","num_speculative_tokens":8,"attention_backend":"ROCM_AITER_UNIFIED_ATTN","disable_padded_drafter_batch":true}' --no-async-scheduling`.

All tunables are `${VAR:-default}` in the compose file; override via the shell or a `.env` file without
editing it. The full knob list (kernel toggles, draft controller, AITER routing, …) is in
[DOCKERHUB.md](DOCKERHUB.md).

## What's inside

Everything below is baked into the image; the tuned paths are env-gated and on by default. See
**[DOCKERHUB.md](DOCKERHUB.md)** for the per-knob reference: every flag, its default, and what it does.

- **gfx1201 correctness patches** (always on): GPU enumeration, AITER enablement, native sampler fallback,
  MTP drafter unpad + multimodal draft-mask alignment, tool-parser + `from_json` chat-template filter, and
  an attention LDS fit that shrinks the staged K/V tile into the R9700's 64 KiB shared memory for any head
  size and KV dtype (AITER sizes it for a larger LDS; without this, 2-byte KV at head 256 and fp8 KV at
  head 512 both abort at CUDA-graph capture).
- **RDNA4-tuned kernels**: preshuffled FP8 blockscale GEMM, unified-attention tiling (fp8 + bf16/`auto` KV,
  plus a head-size-keyed long-context prefill config for models with large attention heads such as Gemma's
  head-512 global layers), fused RMSNorm+quant, an fp16 matrix-core (WMMA) gated-delta-net path, a TP=2 P2P
  one-shot all-reduce (optional fp8 payload), and a native head_dim-72 ViT flash kernel for multimodal
  vision encoders.
- **Fine-grained MoE support** (e.g. Qwen3.6-35B-A3B): RDNA4-tuned fused-MoE Triton configs (always on;
  removes the stock config's `M>=96` cliff for a lower prefill TTFT, lossless), plus a custom bf16 MoE-gate
  GEMM (`RADIANCE_MOE_ROUTER`) for the `n` in `[6,16]` band that rocBLAS serves poorly. Both inert on
  models they do not apply to.
- **Lossless dynamic MTP drafting**: a per-request confidence gate plus verbatim n-gram tail that varies
  draft depth without changing what the model verifies.
- **Prefix caching that works on the GDN hybrid** (enabled in the compose): hybrid models leave automatic
  prefix caching off by default, so it is turned on explicitly with `--enable-prefix-caching
  --mamba-cache-mode=align`. Align mode snapshots and restores the linear-attention (GDN) recurrent state at
  block boundaries (verified bit-identical to full recompute, including under MTP), giving a large TTFT drop
  on shared prefixes (system prompts, RAG, agentic context).
- **Startup topology + bandwidth sweep** (`RADIANCE_RUN_BWTEST`, on by default): device list, P2P access
  matrix, NUMA distances, and peak uni/bidirectional copy bandwidth per agent pair, from a
  `rocm-bandwidth-test` compiled into the image. Backgrounded and about a second, so it never delays the
  serve. Set `0` to skip.
- **Optional NUMA pinning** (`--numa-bind`, off by default) for multi-NUMA-node hosts.

## Layout

Flat build context: the runtime Python modules (`radiance_*.py`), the `patch_*.py` fixes, the `fp8-configs/`
and `moe-configs/` GEMM configs, the HIP kernel sources (`router_gemm.hip`, `radiance_ar_ext.hip`,
`radiance_ar_quant_ext.hip`), the chat template, `Dockerfile`, and `docker-compose.yml` all live at the repo
root so `docker build .` works directly. `prune_rocm.sh` is the ROCm slimming step (it self-checks: the
arch's own kernels must survive and hipcc must still link a HIP shared object, since AITER JITs at runtime). The `Makefile` is a side tool for rebuilding a single HIP kernel
against the image's toolchain during development; the image build compiles them itself.
